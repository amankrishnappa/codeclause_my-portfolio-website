          Class Scheduling: Provide a user-friendly interface for scheduling classes, assigning teachers to specific subjects and classes, and managing classroom availability.

        <h3>crossy road( mini project)</h3>
        <p>Game Mechanics: Implement the core game mechanics of Crossy Road, where the player controls a character to navigate through a busy road and cross it safely. Include features such as moving vehicles, gaps, and obstacles that the player needs to avoid.

          Character Selection: Provide a variety of characters for the player to choose from, each with its own unique appearance and characteristics. Some characters could be unlocked by achieving specific goals or collecting in-game currency.
          
          Random Level Generation: Design a system that generates random levels or road layouts, ensuring that each gameplay session offers a fresh and unique experience. Randomize the positions of vehicles, obstacles, and gaps to keep the game challenging and engaging.
          
          Score and Progression: Implement a scoring system where the player earns points for successfully crossing the road or achieving certain milestones. Keep track of the player's high score and provide rewards or unlockables as they progress further in the game.
          
          Power-ups and Collectibles: Include power-ups or collectible items that the player can acquire during gameplay to gain temporary advantages, such as invincibility, extra lives, or speed boosts. These power-ups can enhance the gameplay experience and add strategic elements.</p>
